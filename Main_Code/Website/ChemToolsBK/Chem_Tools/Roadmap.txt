Prepare a PopOS Machine in the laptop!!

To make your website available online from your local computer in Sao Carlos using the Claro network, follow this roadmap:

1. Prepare your website:
   - Ensure your website files are complete and functioning correctly on your local machine.
   - Optimize your site for performance and security.

2. Set up your local environment:
   - Install Node.js if you haven't already, as it includes a simple HTTP server.
   - Use a tool like XAMPP or WAMP if you need a more robust local server environment.

3. Configure your router:
   - Access your router's settings (usually via 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1).
   - Set up port forwarding for port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to your computer's local IP address.

4. Get a static IP or use Dynamic DNS:
   - Contact Claro to inquire about a static IP address (may incur additional costs).
   - Alternatively, set up a Dynamic DNS service like No-IP or DuckDNS to handle your changing IP address.

5. Choose a domain name:
   - Register a domain name through a domain registrar.
   - Configure your domain's DNS settings to point to your IP address or Dynamic DNS.

6. Implement security measures:
   - Install and configure a firewall on your computer.
   - Set up HTTPS using a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.

7. Start your local server:
   - Use Node.js http-server or your chosen server software to serve your website.

8. Test your setup:
   - Access your website from outside your local network using your domain name.
   - Ensure all features work correctly.

9. Maintain your server:
   - Regularly update your operating system and server software.
   - Monitor your server's performance and security.

10. Consider alternatives:
    - If maintaining a home server becomes challenging, consider migrating to a cloud hosting service for better reliability and easier management.

Remember that hosting a website from home may violate Claro's terms of service and can have limitations in terms of reliability and performance. It's generally recommended for testing and development purposes rather than hosting production websites[1][3].
